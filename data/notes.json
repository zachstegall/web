Can you wait on me for 15 minutes until I'm done? Thanks.\"<br><br>Uh.. you're welcome? I guess I have no choice but to wait on you since you're assuming I am ok doing that kind of thing for you. Did that make things easier and more assuring for your lunch plans with me? To give me a <i>Thanks</i>, rather than asking and giving me the option of deciding if you are worth waiting on?<br><br>Turns out, it would've been bad for you giving me the option, so... well played. But next time, our lunch plans are CANCELLED.<br><br>NO THANKS!",
